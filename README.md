# hello-world
I'm here right now, but probably not as you read this - RL 5/6/2020 4:17AM

Now it's 4:20AM. I am doing this as I procrastinate some Quantitative and Statistical Business Analysis homework that I am getting done. I will be soon finished having time with these professors & this school's resources for a bit - I should try to take the most out of this experience! Forreal. Now I'm in school to win it this time; screw being mediocre.. I got too much I don't know to be complaining about shit. There's a million and more directions I could take with this life. Eliminate the bullshit, but learn how to do the good shit.
